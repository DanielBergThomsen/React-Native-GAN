# React-Native-GAN
This is an experimental project where I make use of the react-native-tensorflow inference
library to generate handwritten digit images using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
I trained in Keras on mobile hardware.

# How to get up and running
1. Make sure you have the following modules installed: react-native-tensorflow, gaussian,
react-native-canvas, react-native-fs and react-native-fetch-blob. 
2. Run `react-native run-android` to create a build for Android.
